        Hi, my name is Khubchehra Naghzibekova, 11 grade in Lycee for gifted sutdent.I am the eldest daughter in my family, and part of the responsibility lies on me. I have one sister and one brother whom I need to help with their studies, as well as with household works. In my free time, I love cooking and turning up the music loud while singing along.Also I like dancing like pamirian, indian and some trend which popular in social media.
        Since this year I am already in the 11th grade, I decided to apply to universities such as AUCA, KIMEP, UCA, and RUDN to study journalism, more specifically SMM.I thought for a long time about what to study, every year I changed professions, but this year I am absolutely sure of my decision.
        Since childhood I was shy and timid, I didn't really communicate with anyone, but gradually I changed for the better, I became more open and communicative. I started going to the American space where I became more openminded and confident. After few years I I already became a volunteer. In general I want to say that it was not in vain that I went there. Also I participated in many programs like Console Academy, Influncer Academy, Mentorship for girls, Teen Up, Coding for girls,NextGen Summit 2025.
